# 👋 Hi there, I'm Austin

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a full-stack software engineer with a unique journey into the tech world. Before I discovered my passion for coding, I was applying my analytical skills in the field of signals intelligence and electronic warfare with the U.S. Marine Corps.

## 🧰 Toolbox
My current toolbox includes:
- 🐍 Python
- 💻 JavaScript
- ⚛️ React
- 🎷 Django 4
- 🐘 PostgreSQL
- 🍃 MongoDB
- ⚡ FastAPI

I've also had hands-on experience with CI/CD practices, microservices architecture, and Agile methodologies. But I know the tech world is always changing, and I'm excited to continue learning and growing, always ready to dive into new languages and frameworks.

## 🧩 What drives me?
What drives me isn't just the technology itself. It's the ability of turning a concept into a tangible application, of finding an elegant/efficient solution to a challenging problem, and of seeing users interact with something I've built.
