# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Austin

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a full-stack software engineer with a unique journey into the tech world. Before I discovered my passion for coding, I was applying my analytical skills in the field of signals intelligence and electronic warfare with the U.S. Marine Corps.

I've also had hands-on experience with CI/CD practices, microservices architecture, and Agile methodologies. But I know the tech world is always changing, and I'm excited to continue learning and growing, always ready to dive into new languages and frameworks.

## ðŸ§© What drives me?
What drives me isn't just the technology itself. It's the ability of turning a concept into a tangible application, of finding an elegant/efficient solution to a challenging problem, and of seeing users interact with something I've built.
